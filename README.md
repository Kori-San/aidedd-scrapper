# 🐉 AideDD Scrapper
A Shell Web Scrapper for [AideDD](https://aidedd.org) to get french DnD 5e informations in French !

# How to use it ?
Just run any of the scripts present here (files ending with `.sh`).

```bash
$ ./spells.sh
# ie. Here we run the script to get all the spells
```

You will the generate a JSON file with the following naming convention:
```bash
$SCRIPT_NAME.$TIMESTAMP.json
# ie. For the `spells.sh` it will be `spells.$TIMESTAMP.json` file
```
